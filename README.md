Description:
This project explores the application of text mining techniques to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (legitimate). Using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains 5,574 SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham, the project develops a machine learning model to automatically detect and classify spam messages.

Key Features:
Data Exploration: The dataset is thoroughly explored to understand the distribution of spam and ham messages.

Text Preprocessing: The text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removal of stop words, and normalization to prepare it for modeling.

Model Development: A machine learning model is trained to classify the SMS messages using various text mining and feature extraction techniques.

Word Cloud Visualization: A word cloud is generated to visually represent the most frequent words in the spam messages, highlighting common spam indicators.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to ensure reliable classification.

Technologies Used:

•	Python

•	scikit-learn for machine learning

•	wordcloud for visualization

•	pandas and numpy for data manipulation

•	matplotlib for plotting
